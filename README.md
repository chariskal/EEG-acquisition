Cpp source code for my NTUAthens thesis at CSL.
Topic: "Grasping through robotic tele-operation based on EEG signals"

Context: Design of a BCI based on features extracted by EEG signals in order to tele-operate a mitshubishi PA10 robotic arm with the intent to grasp an object. EEG signals used were artifacts related to eye and eyelid movement.

Operating all robotic devices using the ROS framework. Cpp was chosen for the final real-time experiment using a human subject that grasps an object by closing their eyes.
